# 🌐 CyberAware – Real-Time Global Cyberattack Visualizer
> A visually immersive web application that maps and educates users about real-world cyberattacks in real time.

## 📌 Inspiration

Cybercrime is on the rise—ransomware, phishing, and DDoS attacks are disrupting global operations daily. As cybersecurity learners, we wanted to create an application that visualizes how often and where these attacks occur, while educating users on what they are and how to stay protected.

## 🛠 Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Displays 40+ real-world cyberattacks with location markers.
- 💡 **Glassmorphic Playcards**: Animated, beautifully styled attack details.
- 🎬 **Welcome Animation**: Elegant loader screen powered by `Orbitron` font and neon glow.
- 🧭 **Landing Instructions**: A guided onboarding screen with scroll-to-map behavior.
- 🔍 **Prevention Tips**: Educates users on how to mitigate each attack type.
- 📬 **Contact Form**: Integrated contact form with email support via FormSubmit.io.
- ✅ **Thank You Page**: Custom success screen after form submission with consistent UI design.
